# Retention & Disposition / Document Retention

Documents in infoRouter can be retained by applying a Retention and Disposition schedule. This prevents the deletion of the document until the defined retention period is reached.

A document that has a retention schedule applied is protected for the entire period defined in the schedule.

Example:

* A document is retained for a period of 3 years
* The document is then moved to an archive folder
* The document stays in archive for 7 years
* The document is either transferred or destroyed

A Retention and disposition schedule can be applied to documents by navigating to the document properties window.
