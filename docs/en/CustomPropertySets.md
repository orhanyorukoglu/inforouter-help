# Custom Property Sets / Examples and Usage Scenarios

Custom Property Sets in Action:

Example 1:

Let's assume, you create multiple documents under multiple projects that are specific to customers. In this case, your custom property name might be called "Project" and it might contain fields like "Project Name", "Customer Name", "Section", "Country", "Contract Date", etc.

As documents are created, you would assign the "Project" Custom Property information by filling out the defined fields.

Now, using the Advanced Search page, you can search for documents by specifying the "Project" custom property and specify values for these custom fields. infoRouter would be able to quickly return all documents related to this customer by narrowing down the search results.

Example 2:

Let's assume that you manage invoice documents in various folders in infoRouter. In this case, you would create a custom property called "Invoice".

This custom property would contain fields like "Invoice amount", "Invoice Date", "Customer Name" etc.

Using the advanced search screen, you could specify that you are looking for documents that have an "Invoice" property set attached, and , you are looking for an invoice that you issued to ACME Inc. You also remember that the invoice amount was more than $1,300.00.

This search would only return those documents that fit the custom property criteria, giving you a much shorter list of documents to go through.

Custom Property Sets can be assigned to documents and folders in their respective "Properties" window.

You may also enter or alter data for the custom property by clicking on the "Edit" button in the "Properties" window.

Notice that the Advanced Search window also includes a field where you can choose a custom property set. When selected, the window will expand so that all the custom property set information is available. You may specify a value for any of these prompts and search for documents and folders that fit the specified query.
