## Version Comments

Version comments are different from document comments — they're attached to specific versions and created when checking in documents.

|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Document Comments** | Anytime | General notes about the document |
| **Version Comments** | During check-in | Notes about specific version changes |

### Viewing Version Comments

1. Open **Document Properties**
2. Click **Versions** in the left sidebar
3. Version-specific comments appear under each version

!!! info "Who Can Add Version Comments"
    Only users with **Change** permissions can add version comments, as they're created during the check-in process.
