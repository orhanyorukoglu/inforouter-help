# Personal Dashboard / My Subscriptions

infoRouter allows you to subscribe to documents and folders.

When you subscribe to a document, infoRouter automatically starts tracking a
set of various document events. When the subscribed events occur,
infoRouter alerts you by sending you an e-mail notification.

When you subscribe to a folder, infoRouter automatically starts tracking a set
of various events for this folder. When new documents are published into
subscribed folders, and changes to existing documents occur, infoRouter alerts you by
sending you an e-mail notification.

Clicking on this link displays a flat list of such documents and folders
regardless of where they are in the system.
