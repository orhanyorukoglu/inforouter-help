# Administrative Functions / Recycle Bin Management

The System Recycle Bin is the central location for all deleted documents in infoRouter.
The "System Administrator" and members of the "Administrators" system user group can access to the system recycle bin.

Documents and folders deleted by users all appear in their own recycle bins but also the system recycle bin. Even when users "empty" their recycle bins, these deleted items continue to appear in the system recycle bin.

Restoring Deleted Documents:

When users delete a document or folder belonging to another user (something they can only do if they have "Full Control" over the document or folder) the deleted items will go into the Recycle Bin of the user who deleted the document.

If the user who owns the document wishes to restore the document, the System Administrator must step in.

To do this, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the "Control Panel"
2. Click on the "System Recycle Bin" link to display the "System Recycle Bin"
3. Specify search criteria relevant to your search.
4. Click "Find" to execute your search.
5. Select the document or folder from the search results and click "Restore"

Re-claiming Disk Space by Purging Recycle Bin entries:

In order to re-claim valuable disk space, the Recycle Bin has to be cleaned up periodically. To do this, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the "Control Panel".
2. Click on the "Search in "Recycle Bin" link.
3. Specify a date in the "Date Deleted" section.
     
    Note: Every document deleted between the two dates will be returned
4. Check all the documents and folders you wish to Purge.
5. Click on the "Empty" button

The selected documents will be permanently purged from infoRouter.

Automatic purging of the system recycle bin:

The system recycle bin is automatically purged by infoRouter at defined time intervals. This has been implemented to prevent the system recycle bin from getting overly bloated. To control this time interval, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the "Control Panel".
2. Click on the "General Application Settings" link.
3. Scroll down to the section labeled "System Recycle Bin Settings"
4. Check or un-check the check box that allows the automatic purging of the system recycle bin.
5. If checked, specify time period in which documents can stay in the system recycle bin

The selected documents will be permanently purged from infoRouter.
