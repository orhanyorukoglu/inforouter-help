# User Profiles / Editing User Profiles - My Profile

The user profile screen contains information about a particular infoRouter user. infoRouter users can access this screen from their "Personal Dashboard" screen. Authorized users can access this screen to view the user profile for other users. This can be done through the "User Management" link in the infoRouter Control Panel.

The User Profile screen is made up of 4 sections:

1. General Profile
2. Settings and Preferences
3. Task redirection
4. The Profile Sidebar

General Profile:

As a user, you can only change your password in this section. All of the other parameters can only be defined and edited by the System Administrator or authorized users such as members of the "User Managers" system user group.

To change your password, click on the properties icon next to the password field. You will be prompted for your new password twice to confirm that you have entered the new password correctly and consistently.

Settings and Preferences:

As a user, you can set all the parameters in this section.

1. "Language Preference" defines your language setting. All infoRouter messages including screen labels will be presented in the selected language.
2. The "Default Portal" setting takes effect as soon as you log in from the system default portal page. You will be routed to the selected portal after you log in.
3. The "E-mail" setting defines your e-mail address. This e-mail address will be used by infoRouter to send out e-mail notifications.
4. Notification Type
   * None: This option will disable all e-mail notifications from infoRouter.
   * Instant: This option will enable all e-mail notifications to be sent to you as notification whenever events occur.
