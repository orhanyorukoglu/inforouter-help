# Archiving

Archiving takes infoRouter documents, folders, and libraries offline while keeping them accessible when needed. This is ideal for managing completed projects, expired documents, and outdated content.

## What Can Be Archived?

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| :material-library: **Libraries** | Entire libraries with all their content |
| :material-folder: **Folders** | Individual folders and their documents |
| :material-file-document: **Documents** | Individual documents |

## Benefits of Archiving

### Clean Interface

Archived items don't appear in the normal infoRouter interface unless you specifically choose to view them.

!!! tip "Identifying Archives"
    When archives are visible, archived library folders appear in **purple** to distinguish them from online libraries.

### Search Optimization

Search doesn't automatically include archived documents. You can control search scope:

| Search Scope | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Online Only** | Search only active documents (default) |
| **All Documents** | Search both online and archived |
| **Archived Only** | Search only archived documents |

### Full Accessibility

!!! success "Still Accessible"
    Archived content remains just as accessible as online content — it's simply hidden from the default view.

## Viewing Archives

To view archived content:

1. Go to your user settings
2. Enable the **"Show Archives"** option
3. Archived libraries will appear in purple
