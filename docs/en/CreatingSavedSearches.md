# Administrative Functions / Creating Saved Searches

Saved Searches allow you to create a pre-defined search page designed specifically to search for specific types of documents. Better yet, you can design saved search screen for specific users or departments within your organization.

By creating a saved search screen, you eliminate the need to start your search from a complicated search screen (advanced search screen) that tries to cover all possibilities. Instead, you can define just a few prompts, so the user can enter just enough information to get quick results.

As you define the search screen, you can also enter default values for the search criteria which will allow the user to (in most cases)
simply click on "Search" to get the results.

Example:

Simply entering a search criteria for the "Look in" prompt, will narrow the search scope, helping the user achieve a much shorter list of documents to go through.

The System Administrator and designated ["Search and Category Administrators"](CategoryAdministrators.md) can create "Saved Searches"

To create a saved search, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the "Search" Tab to display the advanced search screen.
2. Click on the "New search page" button on the bottom right corner of the screen.
3. Notice that infoRouter will re-display the search page with additional options.
4. Enter the search criteria
5. In the additional section (displayed below the search screen), assign a Name to this search page
6. Assign a Description to this search page
7. Select from the list of search fields by clicking on the check boxes. Selected fields will be visible in the new search page.
8. Click on "Save" to save this search.

This saved search will now appear in the "Search pages" located on the left sidebar.
