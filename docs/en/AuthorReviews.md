## What Happens Next

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Tasks are created for all users defined in the first workflow step |
| 2 | Assignees receive email notifications about their new tasks |
| 3 | Tasks appear in assignees' **My Tasks** section |
| 4 | Workflow progresses as tasks are completed |

## Task Assignment Behavior

!!! info "Single-User Assignment"
    When multiple users are assigned to the same task but only one is required to complete it, infoRouter automatically selects one user and assigns the task only to that person. This prevents duplicate work and confusion.
