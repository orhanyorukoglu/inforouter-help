# Reviews / Submitting documents to workflow

When authors create documents, they may be required to have their documents approved by their bosses, peers etc.

Similarly, a scanned document such as an invoice may have to be submitted to other users for approval.

To submit a document for review, perform the following:

1. Navigate to where your document is located.
2. Select the document you wish to send to review by clicking on the check box next to it.
3. From the "Tools" menu, choose "Send to Workflow"
4. This action will launch a window titled "Send to Workflow" and a list of available workflows will be listed.
5. Select the appropriate workflow and click on the "Ok" button
6. This will create tasks for all defined users in the first step of the workflow.
7. The assignees will receive an e-mail notification indicating that a task has been assigned to them.
8. The assignees will also see their tasks in the "My Tasks" section of infoRouter.

Note:

In cases where multiple users that have been assigned the same task and only one of them is required to perform the task, infoRouter will automatically choose one of the users and assign the task only to that person. Previously the task was assigned to all the defined users in the step then subsequently dropped when one user performed the task.
