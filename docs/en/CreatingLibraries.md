# Document Libraries / Creating Libraries

Only the System Administrator and members of the "Administrators" system user group can create and delete libraries.

To create a Library:

1. Navigate to the infoRouter "Control Panel"
2. Click on the "Libraries" link to display a list of existing libraries
3. Click on the "New Library" link located in the left sidebar.

At the "New Library" screen, perform the following:

1. Enter a Name for the new library
2. Optionally select an existing Library by clicking on the "Select" button of the "Use another library as a template" prompt. This will copy all folders and documents of the selected library into the new library.
3. Check the "Allow Anonymous Access" option if you wish to create the library as an "Anonymous Library".
4. Check the "Hidden Library" option if you wish to hide this library from regular view. This library will only be visible if users set their folder options to display hidden libraries.
5. Enter a Welcome Message.

   As users become members of this new library the System Administrator or the library manager may send out library invitation notices. The welcome message entered here in this section is automatically inserted into the invitation e-mail.
6. Click on the next button to continue the wizard.
7. The Add library members window will appear.
8. Select from the list of global users to add to the library as library members.
9. Click on the next button to continue the wizard.
10. The Add library members (Global User Groups) window will appear.
11. Select from the list of global user groups to add to the library as library members.
12. Click on the next button to continue the wizard.
13. The Folder Security window will appear.
14. This window will allow you to assign security to the previously selected users and groups.

Tip:

Use the "Use another library as a template" option to use a pre-existing library as a template. Caution: Creating a library using a model library may take a long time if the template library is contains a lot of folders and documents.

If you regularly use the same format or folder structure for document libraries, creating a template library may be a very good idea.

Creating and using template libraries:

1. Create a new library
2. Create the folder and sub-folder structure you wish to use for new libraries.
3. Create the documents (if any) you wish to have in each new library you wish to create.
4. Do NOT specify any members for the library so the library is not in plain view of other users.
5. When creating new libraries, use this library as a template.
