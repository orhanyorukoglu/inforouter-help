# Users and User Management / User Groups

A user group is a logical grouping of users. User groups make the distribution of documents and assignment of security easier.

There are three types of user groups

1. Global User Groups
2. System User Groups (roles)
3. Local User Groups

Global user groups are defined at the system level and can be applied to or used in all libraries

Local user groups are defined at the library level and can only be used in the library in which they are created.

Creating a Global User Group:

1. Click on the "Control Panel" link.
2. Click on "Global User Groups".
3. Click on "New" from the left sidebar.
4. Enter a name for the user group.
5. Check the "Private user group" checkbox if you wish to keep the members of this local user group private.
6. Finally click "OK" to create the new global user group.

Adding users to a Global User Group:

1. To add users to the new group, highlight the group name from the list.
2. Click on the "Add Member" link from the left sidebar.
3. Select the users you wish to add to this user group by clicking on the check boxes for each user.
4. Click on the "OK" button.

Creating a Local User Group:

6. Enter a name for the new local user group.
7. Check the "Private user group" checkbox if you wish to keep the members of this local user group private.
8. Finally click "OK" to create the new local user group.

Adding users to a Local User Group:

1. To add users to the new group, select the group name from the list.
2. Click on the "Add Member" link from the left sidebar.
3. Select the users you wish to add to this user group by clicking on the check boxes for each user.
4. Click on the "OK" button.

Deleting a User Group:

1. Navigate to the "User Group" list (either in the "Global User Groups" area, or in the "Local User Groups" area for the library in question).
2. Select the User Group you wish to delete from the "User Group" list.
3. Click on the "Delete" link located in the left sidebar.
4. Click "OK".

System User Groups

System user groups are defined at the system level by the System Administrator.

Members of system user groups are assigned special priveledges called "Roles" that allow members to perform functions usually reserved for the system administrator.

Security considerations:

Only the System Administrator, members of the “administrators” system user group and members of the "User Managers" system user group can create and manage global user groups
