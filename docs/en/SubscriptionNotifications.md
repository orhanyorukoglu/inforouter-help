# Notifications and E-mail / Subscription Notifications

All subscribers to a document or folder will automatically receive an e-mail notification whenever that document is edited. Subscribers to a folder will automatically receive an e-mail notification whenever any document in that folder is edited or added.

As the publisher of a document, you may also force the distribution of e-mail notifications to that document's subscribers by navigating to the "Properties" of a document and clicking on the "Distribute" button.

This will send out an e-mail notification to all subscribed users with a link to the most current version of the document.
