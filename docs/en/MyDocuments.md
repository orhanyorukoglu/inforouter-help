# My Documents - Documents created or owned by you

Clicking on the "My Documents" link will display a flat list of your documents (all documents you own), regardless of where they are in the system. Clicking on any document in this list will open the document.

Use this link to quickly find all your documents without having to navigate to all the folders that contain your documents.
