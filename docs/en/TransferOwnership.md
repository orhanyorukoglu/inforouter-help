# Users and User Management / Transferring ownership

Ownership of infoRouter assets may have to be transferred from infoRouter user to the other. Employee turnover or change of roles may be examples of why this may be needed.

To transfer ownership of documents, folders and other assets to another user perform the following:

1. Click on the "Control Panel" link.
2. Click on the "Manage Users" link located in the infoRouter Control Panel.
3. In the list that appears, select the user.
4. Click "Transfer ownership" link located in the left sidebar.
5. This will launch the "Transfer ownership" window.

In the "Transfer ownership" window, select the new owner.

The new owner will be the [new] owner of the items you select to transfer.

infoRouter assets that can be transferred are the following:

* Library memberships

  This option will transfer all library memberships to the selected user
* User group memberships

  This option will transfer the membership of all user groups to the selected user.
* Library management

  This option will transfer any "Library manager" roles the original user may have to the selected user.
* Security assignments

  Any security permissions granted to the original user will be transferred to the selected user.
* Workflow assignments (roles)

  Any roles defined in workflow definitions will be transferred to the selected user.
* Existing tasks

  All existing tasks that were assigned to the original user will be transferred to the selected user.
* Checked out documents

  Any documents the original user may have checked out will be transferred to the selected user.
* Folder ownerships

  Any folder ownerships will be transferred to the selected user.
* Documents ownerships

  Any document ownerships will be transferred to the selected user.
* Document subscriptions

  Any document subscriptions will be transferred to the selected user.

If you select all the options outlined above, you will effectively transfer all infoRouter assets from the original user to the selected user. This option is usually chosen in cases where an employee leaves the company. The selected user (whether new or existing) will inherit all the infoRouter assets owned by the original user
