# Administrative Functions / Administrative Functions & Tasks

Administrative functions in infoRouter are primarily performed by the System Administrator however; the system administrator can delegate certain functions to other users.

Users and Groups with Administrative roles:

* Administrators (System User Group)
* User Managers (System User Group)
* Audit Managers (System User Group)
* Policy Managers (System User Group)
* Library Managers
* Search & Category Administrators
* Portal Administrators

Users with special privileges may access a special area in infoRouter called the infoRouter Control Panel. The Control Panel contains links to many administrative functions of infoRouter.

In addition to accessing the infoRouter control panel, some of the roles above can perform special functions within document libraries.

Example:

The Library Manager can access all documents within the library regardless of the security that has been assigned to the document.
