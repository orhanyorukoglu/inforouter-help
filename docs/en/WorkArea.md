# The infoRouter Work Area

infoRouter includes a portal interface that greets users. Depending on the options chosen by the creator of the portal, certain navigation options may or may not be available.

!!! info "Familiar Interface"
    The infoRouter Document Library is designed to look and function similar to Microsoft Windows Explorer — folders on the left, files (documents) on the right.
