# The infoRouter Work Area

infoRouter includes a portal interface that greets users. Depending on the options chosen by the creator of the portal, certain navigation options may or may not be available.

You can find out more about this topic in the **"Portal"** section of this help document. The infoRouter Document Library is designed to look and function similar to the Microsoft Windows Explorer.

Folders are displayed on the left, and files (documents) are displayed on the right.

To navigate effectively, take note of the following sections (tabs) of infoRouter:
