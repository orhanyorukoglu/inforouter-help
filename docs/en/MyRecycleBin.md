# My Recycle Bin - Recovering deleted documents

Deleted documents are placed in a special location in infoRouter called the Recycle Bin.

Every infoRouter user has a unique recycle bin that keeps the documents that have been deleted by that user.

infoRouter users can only see the contents of their own recycle bin however, the system administrator can search through every recycle bin to recover documents.

If one of your documents is deleted by another user, only the user who deleted this document or the System Administrator can recover this document.

Depending on the choice of the System Administrator, you may be able to empty your Recycle Bin. If this option is turned on, you will see a button labeled "Empty Recycle Bin".

If you delete a document and wish to recover it, perform the following:

1. Click on the "My Recycle Bin" link under my profile
![recycle bin menu](../images/recovering-documents-recyclebin-menu.jpg)2. This will launch the "Recycle Bin" window which will display all the documents you have deleted.
![recycle bin list](../images/my_recycle_bin_list.jpg)3. Select the document you wish to recover and click on the "Restore" link.
4. You will be prompted for a folder to restore the deleted document.
5. Select a folder and confirm your action.

The document will be restored with all its original information including its versions.

Warning: If you empty your recycle bin, your documents will still be recoverable becuase they will be moved into
the system recycle bin.
The system recycle bin can only be accessed by the system administrator or members of the administrators system user group.
