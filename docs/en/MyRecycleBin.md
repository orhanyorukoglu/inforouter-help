# My Recycle Bin

Deleted documents are placed in the Recycle Bin, allowing you to recover accidentally deleted files.

## How It Works

Every infoRouter user has their own personal Recycle Bin that contains documents they have deleted.

!!! info "Privacy"
    You can only see the contents of **your own** Recycle Bin. The System Administrator can search through all Recycle Bins to recover documents.

## Who Can Recover Documents?
