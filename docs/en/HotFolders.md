infoRouter Hot Folders

Using the infoRouter Hot Folders tool, you can designate watched file system folders for automatic import into infoRouter. The infoRouter Hot Folders tool runs as a service on any network machine and can watch multiple file system folders at the same time.

Any new documents placed into these watched folders are automatically imported into designated infoRouter folders. If the "Convert TIFF to PDF" option is chosen (An application setting), TIFF files are automatically converted to PDF.

Examples and Usage Scenarios

1. Incoming Fax folders.
2. Incoming FTP folders.
3. Incoming Scanned Documents.
4. File system folders that are automatically populated with documents by automated jobs or programs.
