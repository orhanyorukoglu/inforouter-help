# Library Managers

A Library Manager is a user granted special rights to manage a specific library. This allows System Administrators to delegate administrative tasks, making libraries more self-sufficient.

!!! tip "Best Practice"
    Creating one or more Library Managers for each library is recommended. This distributes administrative workload and enables faster response to library-related needs.
