# WebDAV / Using WebDAV

infoRouter WebDAV allows you to use Windows File Explorer to access infoRouter documents and folders.

To begin using infoRouter WebDAV:

1. Create a web folder that points to your infoRouter. For instructions on how to do this,
   [click here](WebdavSetup.md).
2. Click on the WebDAV folder you created on your workstation to access infoRouter WebDAV.
3. This will display a list of infoRouter Anonymous Libraries and a special dummy folder which is named "Click here to Login"
4. In order to login to infoRouter through the WebDAV interface, you must click on this folder.
5. Once you click on this folder, you will be presented with a pop-up login screen. Simply login by supplying your infoRouter credentials.

Navigation in infoRouter WebDAV:

To navigate through the infoRouter folders simply click or double-click on the folders to expose the sub-folders. Clicking or double-clicking on documents will launch the program or tool used to generate the document the same way infoRouter opens documents from the web based front-end.

Deleting Folders and Documents in infoRouter WebDAV:

To delete folders or documents in infoRouter WebDAV, simply navigate to the folder or document and click on it to highlight it, then hit your "Delete" key. All delete operations work just as they do in a regular windows environment. Note: All delete operations are subject to infoRouter security.

Creating Documents in infoRouter using WebDAV:

Now that you have logged in to infoRouter, you may perform all the operations allowed by your specific security settings. Since the introduction of the infoRouter DAV feature, you no longer have to create documents and then upload them into infoRouter. You can simply launch your favorite word processing tool such as Microsoft Word and begin creating documents.

How to create a document using Microsoft Word:

1. Launch Microsoft Word
2. Type in the contents of the document
3. When done, click on the "Save" tool bar item or click on the "File" Menu and choose "SAVE"
4. Because this is a new document, Word will prompt you for a path to save this document.
5. Simply navigate to the network place you created earlier.
6. Select one of the libraries and navigate further into subfolders until you find the infoRouter folder you wish to create this document.
7. Select "Ok" and the document will be saved into infoRouter. Note: Because infoRouter WebDAV follows the same infoRouter security rules, your specific security privileges are used. Therefore you must choose a library and folder to which you have appropriate access rights before attempting to save your document.
