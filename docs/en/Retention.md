# Retention & Disposition / Introduction

A retention and disposition schedule is a plan of action that specifies the period of time records should be retained.
Retention and Disposition schedules provide a method in which records and documents are retained and disposed in a timely and systematic manner. This way, records that should be kept are not deleted and records that should be disposed are not kept longer than they need to be kept.

Retention and Disposition schedules are managed by members of a special user group (system user group) called R&D Managers.

These schedules can then be applied to documents and folders by authorized users.

All documents and folders subject to retention are protected against accidental or deliberate deletion even in cases where the user attempting the delete operation has full privileges.
