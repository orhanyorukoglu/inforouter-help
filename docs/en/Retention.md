# Retention & Disposition

A Retention and Disposition (R&D) schedule specifies how long records should be kept and what happens when that period ends. This ensures documents are retained when needed and disposed of appropriately when no longer required.

## Why Use Retention Schedules?

!!! success "Compliance & Protection"
    - Records that **should be kept** are protected from accidental or deliberate deletion
    - Records that **should be disposed** are not kept longer than necessary
    - Meets regulatory and legal compliance requirements

## Key Features

### Protected Documents

All documents subject to retention are **protected against deletion**, even by users with full privileges.

!!! warning "Delete Protection"
    Users cannot delete documents under retention, regardless of their permission level. This protection remains in effect until the retention period expires.

### Systematic Disposition

R&D schedules ensure documents are disposed of in a timely, systematic manner according to organizational policies.
