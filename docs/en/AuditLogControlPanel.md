# Control Panel / Audit Logs & Reports

The control panel Audit Log displays a list of logged events for all libraries in infoRouter.

Events logged by infoRouter at the system level are as follows:

* New Documents and Folders
* New versions
* Checked out documents
* Check ins
* Version deletes
* Folder and Document Deletes
* Security Audit Log
* Ownership changes

To view the Audit Log for documents and folders for the entire system, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the infoRouter Control Panel
2. Click on the Audit Logs & Reports link
3. The "Audit Log" window will appear.
4. Select the log you wish to view.
5. Specify a date range to narrow the report to a specific time interval
6. Click on the "Show" button to display the log

Important Note:

It is important to note that audit logs can be turned on and off for each individual library in infoRouter. If an audit log for a specific event is not turned on in a given library, these events will not be logged. So even when running these reports from the control panel you will not be able to see these events captured for libraries that do not have the logging turned on.
