# Document Disposition

Document and records disposition allows organizations to dispose of records that are no longer needed. It generally takes place after a document or record has been retained for a period of time and it has outlived its usefulness.

Disposed records may be destroyed or sent off to archives.

Document and folder disposition in infoRouter is defined in Retention and Disposition schedules.

When the retention period of a folder or document has been reached, an optional disposition task may kick in. If the disposition
option has been selected, the disposition task will be automatically assigned to the user defined in the Retention and Disposition schedule.

The task is performed manually by the assigned user.
