# Retention and Disposition / Folder Retention

Folders in infoRouter can be retained by applying a Retention and Disposition schedule. This prevents the deletion of the folder until the defined retention period is reached.

An Retention and Disposition schedule can be applied to documents by navigating to the folder properties window.
