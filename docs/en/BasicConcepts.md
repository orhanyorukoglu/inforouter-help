Libraries:

Libraries (infoRouter work areas) are root-level folders. They can be seen on the left of the image above labeled 1.
Libraries are isolated environments in which a group of users can work, collaborate and produce documents.

Only the members of libraries can navigate inside libraries or even see that they exist.
Users and User Groups are assigned as "Members" to libraries by the System Administrator and
by the members of the "Administrators" and the "User Managers" system user group.
More on this topic in [Libraries](Libraries.md).

Folders:

Folders are used to store and organize documents.
  
 Folders may contain any number of documents in a wide variety of file formats.
  
 Like libraries, access to folders is subject to security permissions. Users may be granted or denied access
to individual folders. More on this topic in [Folders](Folders.md).

Documents Pane:

Documents are shown on the right hand side of the screen in the documents pane, labeled 2.

The documents pane contains documents which can be virtually any electronic file produced by applications such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint , WordPerfect, Visio, or any other type of electronic files such as audio and video files.

infoRouter manages all types of electronic documents in their native format. In other words, it does not attempt to convert or interfere with document content. More on this topic in [Documents](Documents.md).

Custom Properties (Meta data):

Custom Property Sets are user defined information sets that can be attached to folders, documents and users. They are used to further define the document, folder or user. A common use for this feature is to allow documents to be searched based on custom information, rather than just their name or content. More on this topic in
[Custom Properties](CustomPropertyIntro.md).

Portals:

infoRouter portals are customizable and can be personalized web pages that are capable of serving infoRouter content. Their main purpose is to greet users and provide content specific to users or a group of users. You may use infoRouter portals to create web pages for your partners, vendors and employees to provide colorful content rather than a dry list of folders and files. Because they are capable of serving content, you may choose to design portals that provide critical content all on the portal and avoid having to allow navigation into the document library. More on this topic in [Portals](PortalsIntro.md).

Content Searching:

infoRouter is capable of performing an internet-like search on documents and folders based on their content. Various common file formats are indexed giving infoRouter users the ability to search for documents based on their text content. You can use various third-party plug-ins called "**iFilters**" to broaden the range of file formats that can be indexed. More on this topic in [Searching in infoRouter](searchbook.md).

Version Control:

infoRouter retains multiple versions of a document. Every time a document is checked out, edited and checked back in, infoRouter creates a new copy of this document and retains all previous versions. All versions are retained until the owner of the document or an authorized user decides to clean up previous versions.

When you click on a document to view its contents, infoRouter delivers the published version of that document. When you check out a document, infoRouter will deliver the latest version making it virtually impossible to accidentally work with an older copy.

Version control allows you to revert back to older versions in case undesirable changes have been made to your documents. More on this topic in [Version Control](VersionControl.md).
