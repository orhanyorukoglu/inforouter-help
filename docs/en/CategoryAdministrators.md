# Categories / Category Administrators

The system administrator can designate infoRouter users as "Search and Category Administrators".

Search and Category Administrators are ordinary infoRouter users with special privileges that allow them to Create, Edit and Delete Document Categories and Saved Searches.

The classification of documents based on categories allows users to quickly search for and retrieve documents from the infoRouter document library.

To designate "Search and Category Administrators", perform the following:

1. Navigate to the "Control Panel"
2. Click on the "Search and Category Administrators" link
3. Click on the "Add Administrator" button
4. Select user(s) from the User list that appears
5. Click "OK"
