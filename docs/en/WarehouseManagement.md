# Administrative Functions / Warehouse Management

The Warehouse Status screen gives the System Administrator vital statistics about disk space usage and how documents are spread out over the drives in the warehouse.

The first section, "Disk Usage", gives you information about all the physical drives participating in your warehouse.

The System Administrator should check the "disk space usage" regularly and make sure that the physical drive has enough capacity.

The second section, "Warehouse Paths", gives you information about the warehouse paths and the amount of disk space used by infoRouter on each path.

The "Warehouse Status" screen can be reached by going to the "Control Panel" and clicking on the "Warehouse Status" link.
