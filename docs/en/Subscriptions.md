# Subscriptions / Introduction

Subscriptions are a mechanism that automatically tracks changes to documents and folders and notifies infoRouter users.

When you subscribe to a document, infoRouter automatically starts tracking the changes to this document and alerts you by sending an e-mail notification informing you of the changes.

When you subscribe to a folder, infoRouter automatically starts tracking the changes to this folder. infoRouter then alerts you by sending an e-mail notification informing you when new documents are created in this folder or when any of the documents within the folder are changed.

These events are:

* New Documents
* Read
* Change (New versions)
* Update (Meta changes to document properties)
* Checkout
* Approve
* Reject
* Comment
* Move
* Delete
* Check In

When you subscribe to a folder, infoRouter sends you an e-mail notification whenever a new document is created in that folder or a document in that folder is edited.

To see a list of all your subscriptions, click on "My Subscriptions" in your profile section.
