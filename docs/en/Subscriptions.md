# Subscriptions

Subscriptions automatically track changes to documents and folders and notify you when changes occur.

## How Subscriptions Work

### Document Subscriptions

When you subscribe to a document, infoRouter tracks all changes and sends you email notifications.

### Folder Subscriptions

When you subscribe to a folder, infoRouter notifies you when:

- New documents are created in the folder
- Existing documents in the folder are modified
