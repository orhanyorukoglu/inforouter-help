# Document Libraries / Introduction

Libraries are root-level folders that can be created and managed by the System Administrator. The System Administrator can delegate library management functions to other users by assigning [Library Managers](LibraryManagers.md).

Libraries are isolated environments in which a group of users can work, collaborate and produce documents. Only the members of libraries can navigate inside libraries or even see that they exist.

Users and User Groups are assigned as "Members" to libraries by the System Administrator and "Library Managers".

The System Administrator and Library managers can also create "Local Users" within libraries. Local users are created locally inside individual libraries. Local users cannot cross into other libraries through library memberships. They are only visible in the library in which they were defined. Local users can perform the same functions as regular users but only in their defined library.

Note:

Users and User Groups can be members of multiple libraries

There are two types of libraries.

* Common libraries
* Anonymous libraries

Why use Anonymous libraries?

Anonymous libraries are used to publish public documents into a common area where everyone who can navigate to the library can access documents without having to log on or be defined as an infoRouter user. Anonymous users will be able to click on and view documents in anonymous libraries (subject to security) but only logged in users will be able to edit documents.

Common uses of libraries

* To form a private work group area. For example, the Human Resources department may be set up with a library that only they can see and access.
* To store sensitive documents or projects in a private area. For example, the Legal department may have contractual requirements to keep documentation separate from general-purpose documentation.
* Allow customers, partners, and vendors access to specific isolated areas (via anonymous libraries) without having to give them access to everything else.
