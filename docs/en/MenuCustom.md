# The Menu System / Custom Menus

infoRouter allows you to create custom menu items with sub-menus This feature allows integration with other systems such as home-grown applications and third-party tools.

When a custom menu is launched by the user, infoRouter automatically passes vital information about the current folder, selected folders and documents along with user information etc. to the program that is being called by the menu.

This information can then be used by the external application. The external application can talk back to infoRouter using our Web Services API.

For more information on how to create custom menus, please refer to this guide:
