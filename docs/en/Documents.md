# Documents / Introduction

Whether you work in words, pictures, audio, or video, infoRouter can manage any type of document or file in its **native format**.

infoRouter allows users to create, manage, share and distribute almost any form of electronic document using any desktop software or tool.

Word processing documents, reports, forms, audio, video, artwork (any type of graphics), photographs, engineering documents, drawings and virtually any file format can be stored and managed in infoRouter.

There are 6 types of documents in infoRouter:

Regular Documents

Regular documents are typical files created by desktop applications such as Word, Excel, etc. Once they are created, they are uploaded to infoRouter.

Template Documents

Template documents are documents created directly inside of infoRouter by using Templates. Template documents are always of HTML type. These documents can be rendered with other templates making them very powerful.

Document Shortcuts

Shortcuts are also treated as documents. They can be created in any folder and point to any document in infoRouter. The most common use for shortcuts is to provide access to documents to users who cannot navigate to the original location of the document.

URLs

URLs are also treated as documents. They can be created in any folder and they are used to point to external or internal web sites or pages.

Built-in HTML Editor

This tool allows users to create to new HTML documents which can also be viewed in PDF format. The new editor can be launched under the new menu.

E-mail Registration

You may register e-mails in EML format using the new menu and uploading the EML file into infoRouter just like any another document.

EML formats are automatically parsed out to create the different sections of an e-mail and presented in the infoRouter e-mail format.

Emails can also be registered into infoRouter by using the MS Office Add-in within MS Outlook.

Remember, only e-mail formats with the EML extension are allowed through the web interface. Outlook (MSG format) e-mails are automatically processed through the MS Office Integration Add-in.

An important point to remember about e-mail documents are that these documents cannot be edited (Checked out).

Emails are treated as documents, so they can be copied, moved, deleted, searched for, etc. and are subject to security just like other document formats.
