# Library Members

Libraries can only be accessed by their members (except for Anonymous Libraries). Membership determines who can see and work within a library.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Visibility** | Libraries are invisible to non-members |
| **Multiple Memberships** | Users and groups can be members of multiple libraries |
| **Security Lists** | Only library members appear in user lists when assigning security |

!!! info "Anonymous Libraries"
    Anonymous Libraries are the exception — they can be accessed without membership by anyone who can navigate to them.
