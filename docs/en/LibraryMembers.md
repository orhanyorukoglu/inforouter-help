# Libraries / Library Members

Libraries can only be accessed by its members (except for Anonymous libraries).

The System Administrator assigns "Users" and "User Groups" as "Members" to libraries from the "Libraries" screen
in the "Control Panel".

Library managers can create "Local Users" and "Local User Groups"

Notes:

Users and User Groups can be members of multiple libraries.

Libraries are not visible to users who are non-members.

When assigning Folder and Document Security in a library, only the library members appear in the user list.

[Users](Users.md)

Security Considerations:

Library members can be managed by the System Administrator and members of the "Administrators" system user group, Library Managers and members of the User Managers group.
