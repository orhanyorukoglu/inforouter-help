# Subscriptions / Subscribing to Documents and Folders

When documents are revised, it is difficult for interested parties (Managers, Project Managers and Content Managers) to find out about it. If you are one of those interested parties, you can subscribe to documents and folders to be automatically notified of such changes.

It may be very important to know immediately when a critical document such as a contract or proposal document is revised. It may also be very important to know immediately when new documents are created, approved, rejected and so on.

To subscribe to documents, perform the following:

1. Select the document(s) you wish to subscribe to by clicking on the check boxes located next to the documents in the document list.
2. Click on the "Subscribe" menu item under the "Edit" menu.
3. The "Subscribe" window will appear.
4. Select the events to which you wish to subscribe by clicking on the event check boxes.
5. Click "Ok" to subscribe to the chosen events for the document.

To subscribe to folders, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the folder.
2. Click on the "Subscribe" menu item under the "Edit" menu.
3. The "Subscribe" window will appear.
4. Select the events to which you wish to subscribe by clicking on the event check boxes.
5. Click "Ok" to subscribe to the chosen events for the folder.
