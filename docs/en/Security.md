# Security / Introduction

infoRouter provides for a very powerful and flexible security environment. Security can be administered at various levels (Library, Folder and Document).

infoRouter's security is very similar to Microsoft Windows NT/2000/2003/2008/2012 security, with a few exceptions.

Levels of Security

Library Level Security

The first level of infoRouter security is at the library (root-level folder) level.

Libraries are isolated environments in which a group of users can work, collaborate and produce documents. Only the members of a Library can navigate inside document libraries or even see that they exist.

In addition to membership requirements, library policies also determine a set of rules in which users can perform certain actions. For more on this topic, please navigate to [Library Policies](LibraryPolicies.md)

Folder Level Security

The second level of infoRouter security is at the folder level. Access to folders within a library is subject to [Folder Security](FolderSecurity.md).

Document Level Security

The third level of infoRouter security is at the document level.

Access to documents within folders is subject to [Document Security](DocumentSecurity.md).
