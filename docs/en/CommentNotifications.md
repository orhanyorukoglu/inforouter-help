# Notifications and E-mail / Comment Notifications

An infoRouter user with (at least) "Read" permissions to a document, can add comments.

When a document comment is entered, an "E-mail Notification" is generated and delivered to all users who have subscribed to the document and chosen to receive comment notifications.

This e-mail specifies the following information:

* The author of the comment
* The date of the comment
* The text of the comment

For more information on this topic, and to find out how you can add comments to a document, see [Document Comments](DocumentComments.md).
