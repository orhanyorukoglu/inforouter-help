# Security / Auditing Logins

infoRouter can maintain a log of all logins. This log will show the date, time, and username for all successful logins.
Only the System Administrator and members of the “administrators” system user group can enable or disable this feature.

To enable or disable the Login Log:

1. Go to the "Authentication and Password Policy Settings" section in the "Control Panel".
2. Check or uncheck the check box next to the "Login Log" option.

To view the contents of the Login Log, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the "Application" directory where infoRouter is installed.
2. Further navigate to the sub-folder called "Logs/Logins"
3. This sub-folder contains a daily log of logins in text format.
