# Documents / Viewing Documents

To view the contents of a document, simply click on the displayed document link. The document will be opened with the associated application on your desktop. So if you click on a PDF document, more than likely the Adobe Acrobat Reader will be launched to display the document. Similarly, if you click on a Microsoft Word document, Microsoft Word will be launched and the document will be shown.
