# Introduction to Tasks

Tasks are document-related job assignments that must be performed by infoRouter users. They provide a structured way to request and track work on documents.

## Task Types

infoRouter supports two types of tasks:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| :material-account-arrow-right: **User-Assigned Tasks** | Tasks created and assigned by other users |
| :material-sitemap: **Workflow Tasks** | Tasks automatically assigned as part of a workflow process |

---

## How Tasks Work

1. An authorized user creates a task and assigns it to another user
2. The assignee receives an email notification
3. The assignee can view and manage tasks in [My Tasks](MyTasks.md)
4. The assignee completes the required actions
5. The task is marked as complete

## Task Requirements

Tasks can include one or more of the following requirements:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| :material-file-edit: **Edit** | Edit the document (requires edit permission) |
| :material-eye: **Read Latest Version** | View the most recent version |
| :material-eye-outline: **Read Published Version** | View the published version |
| :material-comment-text: **Provide Task Comments** | Add comments about the task |
| :material-certificate: **Provide ISO Comments** | Add ISO review comments (stored in special log) |
| :material-clipboard-check: **Provide SOX Comments** | Add SOX review comments (stored in special log) |
| :material-delete: **Dispose Document** | Complete document disposition |
| :material-archive: **Archive Document** | Archive the document |
| :material-arrow-down: **Downgrade Classification** | Lower the document's classification level |
| :material-lock-open: **Declassify Document** | Remove classification from document |

## User-Assigned Tasks

These tasks are created manually by clicking a document's action icon and selecting **Create Task**.

The task creator:

- Selects the assignee
- Chooses required actions
- Sets a due date
- Adds instructions

## Workflow Tasks

Workflow tasks are automatically assigned as part of an ongoing workflow process. They follow the same requirements but are triggered by workflow rules rather than manual assignment.
