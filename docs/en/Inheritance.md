# Security / Inheritance

Security inheritance from the parent folder is the default behavior in infoRouter.

Any documents uploaded into a folder or a new folder created under another folder cause the new object (document or folder) to inherit the security settings from its parent folder.

Users have the option to follow the wizards when creating folders or uploading documents to specify security settings for the new document or folder. If this is done, the specified security is applied and no inheritance takes place.

It is also possible to remove security inheritance from an existing folder or document.
