## Typical Corporate Library Layout

A typical organization might create libraries for:

| Department | Library Purpose |
|------------|-----------------|
| :material-calculator: **Accounting** | Financial documents, invoices, reports |
| :material-cart: **Sales** | Proposals, contracts, quotes |
| :material-bullhorn: **Marketing** | Campaigns, collateral, brand assets |
| :material-account-group: **Human Resources** | Policies, employee records, forms |
| :material-laptop: **Information Services** | Technical documentation, procedures |
| :material-headset: **Customer Service** | Support guides, FAQs |
| :material-help-circle: **Help Desk** | Tickets, knowledge base articles |

    Each department typically has its own policies, procedures, and security requirements. Separate libraries allow:

    - **Different retention policies** per department
    - **Unique security settings** for sensitive data
    - **Separate audit trails** for compliance
    - **Custom workflows** for each business area
