# Additional Modules / infoRouter E-mail Scanner

infoRouter E-mail scanner is a tool that is designed to monitor multiple E-mail accounts hosted at any POP3 server. The e-mails sent to these accounts are automatically pulled into designated infoRouter folders for storage and distribution.

Even non-infoRouter users can send e-mails to these monitored e-mail accounts and have their e-mails automatically appear in infoRouter. The e-mail attachments are also stored in emails. infoRouter is capable of indexing the attachments so when users search for a content phrase, infoRouter will be able to return e-mail documents in the search results.
