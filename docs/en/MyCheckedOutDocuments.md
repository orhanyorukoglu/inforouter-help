# My Checked Out Documents

The **My Checked Out Documents** view displays all documents currently checked out to you for editing.

## Understanding Check Out

!!! info "Version Control"
    infoRouter does not allow multiple people to edit a document simultaneously. The Check In/Check Out mechanism ensures document integrity by:

    - Preventing conflicting edits
    - Maintaining accurate version history
    - Tracking who is working on each document

---

## What Others See

When you have a document checked out:

| What Others Can Do | What Others Cannot Do |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| :material-check: View the document | :material-close: Edit the document |
| :material-check: See that you have it checked out | :material-close: Check it out themselves |
| :material-check: Download a copy | :material-close: Create a new version |
