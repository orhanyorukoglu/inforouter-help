## What Are Ignored Keywords?

Ignored keywords (also called "stop words") are common words that appear frequently in documents but don't help narrow search results. infoRouter excludes these words from its search index.

!!! info "Why Ignore Common Words?"
    Words like "the," "and," or "is" appear in almost every document. Including them would make searches slower and return too many irrelevant results.
